# Week 1 - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing and processing crop-related data using a Jupyter Notebook. The primary objectives include:

Data Loading: Importing and preprocessing data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding trends, distributions, and patterns in the data.

Model Implementation: Developing and evaluating models for predicting outcomes.

## Prerequisites

To replicate the notebook or contribute to the project, ensure the following tools are installed:

Python Version: 3.8+

Required Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn


## Visualized data distributions with histograms and box plots.

Used correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.

## Modeling:

Developed machine learning models for predictions.

Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

## Results:

Identified key insights such as significant features and optimal parameters.

## Key Insights

Correlations between specific features highlight trends relevant to crop yield.

The implemented model achieves high accuracy for predictions.

Visualizations provide a clear understanding of data distributions and outliers.
